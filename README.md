# Zendesk Agent Lab
In this project I am navigating Zendesk as a Zendesk Agent by resolving technical support tickets via effective communication, resulting in customer satisfaction. From creating various real-world sample tickets, to resolving and closing these support tickets, and even creating Macros to improve workflows.

## _Ticket Merging_
Sometimes you will get repetitive tickets within a short period of time from the same requester. Merging these tickets saves time for both your organization and the customer.

## _Adding Tickets_
There will be times where a customer will call you and you will need a way to store an interactive history of the ticket request. This is where adding your own ticket on the end-user's behalf is the answer.

## _Macros_
Macros are extremely useful for solving similar tickets. They are essentially automatic responses that you craft for tickets with familiar resolution. These are useful for adding different actions such as Priority, Type, Tags, as well as a preset email response with integrated placeholders.

## _Shortcut Utilization_
_These shortcuts are a game-changer when optimizing your workflow speed while parsing tickets effectively._
